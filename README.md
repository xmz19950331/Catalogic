This is a tool which help us to build up our knowledge base.

In this tool, first you need to upload the log file which you think contains error/warning and that might be the reason for job failure.

Then our tool will save this file into server and help you to filter out necessary information and show you lines with error or warning. Select lines which you think are relative to same error and click confirm.

After clicking confirm, our tool will use Machine Learning Algorithm to calculate similarty with data in our knowledgebase, then return a suggested solution for you. However, as we don't have so much data in our knowledge base, so it's still a dummy solution for now. But the whole frame is complete and in the future when we have enough data, it will turn into real solution.

But let's suppose we have real solution as a suggestion, if you think it's exactly what you want, just click confirm and this data will also be recorded with this suggested solution, otherwise you can write down your solution as new data.

Caution:
During the process, please don't refresh or click "go back" button on the top left of browser.
